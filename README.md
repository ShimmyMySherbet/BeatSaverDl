# BeatSaverDl
An alternate tool to the One-Click installer from the Beat Saber Mod Assistant to handle BeatSaver one-click installs.

The Mod Assistant One-Click installer creates a new window every time you install a map, and it also doesn't provide any info on the map being downloaded. BeatSaverDL creates only 1 window that downloads any maps.

# Settings
### AutoFocus

When enabled, the downloader window will be selected whenever you start a new download.

Keeping this disabled will prevent the downloader window popping up from behind your browser window every time you start a new download.

### NotifyDownloaded

When enabled, BeatSaberDl will send a notification when a map finishes downloading

### BeatSaberPath

Incase BeatSaberDl cannot auto detect your BeatSaber install path, you can set it manually.

# One-Click install handler
This app can handle BeatSaver's OneClick install protocol, meaning you can use it with the one-click install buttons on the BeatSaver website.

You will be prompted if you want to register the handler when you first run the app. If you want to install it later, an option can be found in the settings menu.

## Misc

The app doesn't yet have an icon, I'm yet to make one for it.
